Desribes an interoperable method to perform [DIDComm Messaging](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/) using Bluetooth as a means of transport. An initial write up of the spec can be found in the [spec.md](spec.md). This is still work-in-progress.

This repo contains the spec and reference code to explain DIDComm over Bluetooth.
